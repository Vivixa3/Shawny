**What is project?**

There are many games services out there and it's often hard to find something that doesn't require a machine that has the capacity of sending a spaceship to space or a service that you can use on the web without useless content and a bunch of ads. On the other hand, shawny does both.

For now, we only provide web games that nobody wants to play but we are planning on adding more games that can be played on any platform.


**Where do we find the games**

Very though question...
For now, we make them but it won't be forever. We are constantly searching to collaborate with small game studios to implement their product in our service.

Even if you don't make games, you can contribute. We are always ready to collaborate with people that has great idead.


**Where is the project at right now?**

The project _shawny.app_ is very early in its development. Many changes and improvements are on their ways to provide a service that suits to all needs.


**Where can I find the Demo?**
